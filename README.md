# A small React project to get startet

## This Project is nothing special. I just wanted to get a hang of react, mainly learn how to pass props and generate HTML-Objects from arrays with custom functions.
## It turned out pretty ok i guess. 

## I think, i can go a step further now.

## Project is not hostet anywhere
